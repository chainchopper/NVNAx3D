Phase 1: Persona System Enhancement
Chunk 1.1: Avatar System Foundation
Create avatar mapping system linking personas to unique images

Design/implement 4 distinct avatar styles maintaining liquid animation theme

Add avatar configuration to persona definitions with fallback to default blob

Chunk 1.2: Persona Voice & Personality Definitions
Define unique voice profiles for each persona (NIRVANA, VISION, ADAM, THEO)

Implement personality traits and response styles

Create persona capability matrix mapping strengths to tasks

Chunk 1.3: Dual Persona Loading System
Modify persona carousel to support multi-selection

Implement persona collaboration protocol

Update UI to display active personas with their avatars

Phase 2: Memory System Overhaul
Chunk 2.1: Vector Database Foundation
Set up ChromaDB integration with local storage fallback

Implement Gemini embedding model (text-embedding-004) integration

Create database initialization and management system

Chunk 2.2: RAG Memory Operations
Implement embedContent method for text embedding generation

Create memory storage with metadata (speaker, timestamp, type)

Build similarity search and retrieval system

Chunk 2.3: Enhanced Memory Queries
Add daily memory grouping functionality

Implement speaker tag updating for voice profiling

Create memory relevance scoring system

Phase 3: UI/UX Enhancements
Chunk 3.1: Interface Cleanup
Remove "reset session" icon and associated code

Verify no functionality loss from removal

Clean up any orphaned event handlers

Chunk 3.2: Time & Context Awareness
Implement time announcement system

Create meeting/reminder detection from context

Add proactive notification system

Chunk 3.3: Notes Feature Integration
Design Notes as a memory type

Implement note creation, storage, and retrieval

Add note-specific UI components

Phase 4: Integration & Testing
Chunk 4.1: System Integration
Wire persona system with memory enhancements

Connect time awareness to memory retrieval

Integrate Notes with RAG system

Chunk 4.2: Testing & Optimization
Test persona collaboration scenarios

Validate memory retrieval accuracy

Performance optimization for dual persona loading

Implementation Order Recommendation:
Start with Chunk 1.1 + 1.2 - Persona avatars and definitions (visual impact, foundation)

Then Chunk 2.1 + 2.2 - Memory system core (critical infrastructure)

Follow with Chunk 3.1 - UI cleanup (quick win)

Proceed with Chunk 1.3 - Dual personas (user-facing feature)

Implement Chunk 2.3 + 3.3 - Enhanced queries + Notes (memory features)

Finish with Chunk 3.2 + 4.1 + 4.2 - Time awareness & integration (polish)

Each chunk is designed to be independently testable while building toward the complete system. The persona enhancements and memory overhaul can be developed in parallel once their foundations are laid.
