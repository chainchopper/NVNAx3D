in addition to the aforementioned, the voice input processing and output needs to be natural so some way of chunking these in sequence or allowing speakers to interrupt should  be in  place as i believe we already coded but may not be wired properly still. The voice input icon should be made to go into the typing field as well clearning the  large icon from the main interface as well as the upload file icon. you'll then re place the keyboard icon altogether and replace it with an   animated glowing "N" which  will reveal  the texti nput field that should now include the microphone toggle, file upload icon,  a  brain icon to allow thinking, and a web icon to allow  internet searching which means we need mechanisms and  packages perhaps even some of the docker compose related services can assist with this like tika. seems voice input is o nly serving to reactive function for the 3d visualizer and not sharing with recording capabilities or whisper transscriptions even though  whisper is loaded and running locally. create a ta sk to address the issues above by  adding and sorting your task list without forgetting where things are or being destructive to things that work. if you find more mockups or improperly wired things in your path then autonomously add them to the task list and fix them to be wired up and  actually working rather than mock.  a good example of  this is the fact that we have registered tools such as "Get cryptocurrency price, get market  news, set prtice alerts, send sms, make  phone call, search gmail, send gmail none of which s eem to be  working and wired correctly for the personi to use. address these issues along with the errors im including adding all to your current task list and executing. I 've also  noticed a bug when clickin the icon for Personi management where when the menu/drawer opens, so does a second instance of the personi carousel which is undesireable.. I've also noticed that the Vision AI icon does not open a menu w/ proper z order
