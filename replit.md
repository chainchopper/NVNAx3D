# Nirvana - PersonI AI System

## Overview
Nirvana is an advanced AI companion system featuring multiple AI personas (PersonI - Personified Intelligence) with unique personalities, voices, and capabilities. It integrates Google's Gemini AI for real-time audio interaction and immersive 3D visualizations. The system's core purpose is to provide highly customizable and engaging AI companions, offering a modular and extensible platform for personalized AI experiences. The project aims to be local-first, multi-provider, and capable of integrating with various external services, positioning itself as a versatile personal AI ecosystem with significant market potential.

## User Preferences
- **Graphics Preference**: WebGPU over WebGL (better performance)
- **Local-First**: Prefer on-device processing (Whisper for STT)
- **Flexibility**: Manual configuration of all endpoints and services
- **Not locked into Google's ecosystem**: Multi-provider support essential

## System Architecture

### Core Technologies
- **Framework**: Lit (Web Components)
- **Build Tool**: Vite 6.2
- **AI Provider**: Google Gemini API (@google/genai), with multi-provider support
- **3D Graphics**: Three.js (WebGL, planned WebGPU migration)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Backend**: Express.js (Node.js) for secure connector API proxy

### Key Components
- **PersonI System**: Defines AI personas with unique personalities, voices, models, and visual styles, including specific capabilities (vision, image generation, web search, tools, Multi-modal Conversational Pipeline - MCP). Features a template system for custom PersonI creation and includes a financial advisor PersonI named BILLY with vision capabilities and financial connectors.
- **3D Visualization**: WebGL-based animated 3D objects with texture mapping, enhanced idle animations (8 modes), and audio-reactive visuals. PersonI have unique visual configurations and dynamic backgrounds.
- **Main Component**: Manages audio I/O, Gemini AI streaming, PersonI switching, and voice activity detection.
- **Connector Backend Proxy**: Secure Express.js server for external service integrations (e.g., Gmail, Google Calendar, GitHub, Linear, Notion, Slack, financial APIs), handling OAuth tokens and API keys server-side.
- **Model Provider System**: Manages configuration and integration of multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Google, custom endpoints) and their models.
- **Memory & RAG System**: Vector-based memory using ChromaDB (with localStorage fallback) and Gemini embedding model. Supports 17 memory types (conversations, financial, files, etc.) with semantic search, temporal queries, and speaker management. Includes a RAG memory toggle for user control (minimalist brain emoji üß† design).
- **User Profile System**: Stores user-specific information for context.
- **Local Speech-to-Text (STT)**: Integration of browser-based Whisper models (@xenova/transformers) with IndexedDB caching.
- **Enhanced Audio System**: SharedMicrophoneManager for concurrent audio consumers, audio recording manager, and real-time music detection system with BPM estimation and beat-synchronized 3D visuals.
- **Song Identification System**: Soundhound-style song recognition via AudD API with lyrics (Genius API), UI display, and RAG memory integration.
- **Environmental Awareness Suite**: Real-time camera-based contextual observation. Includes a Camera Manager component with minimalist controls (üëÅÔ∏è preview toggle, üì∑ camera toggle), Camera-as-3D-Background, Vision-Enhanced Idle Speech (analyzing live camera frames), and an Environmental Observer Service for continuous monitoring and proactive assistance. Features a multi-format file upload system with RAG integration for analyzed content and metadata.
- **Object Recognition System**: Real-time object detection using TensorFlow.js and COCO-SSD model. Detects 80 object classes with confidence scores, bounding boxes, FPS tracking, and visual overlay with proper video scaling.
- **Voice Command System**: Hands-free control with 20+ natural language commands (PersonI switching, camera control, panel management, volume, object detection, notes/tasks, etc.). Pattern-based matching with parameter extraction and structured return values.
- **Dual PersonI Manager**: Multi-AI collaboration system with 4 modes (collaborative, debate, teaching, single). Features turn management, conversation history, intelligent switching logic, and primary persona preservation.
- **Calendar System**: Visual calendar component with month/week/day/agenda views, natural language event creation ("Meeting with John tomorrow at 2pm"), and integration-ready Google Calendar backend support.
- **CSP Security Hardening**: Implemented Content Security Policy for secure content delivery.
- **Chatterbox-TTS Integration**: Custom TTS API support with configurable endpoint, voice synthesis, voice cloning capabilities, and a dedicated configuration UI.

### UI/UX Decisions
- **Minimalist Design Philosophy**: Clean, uncluttered interfaces with essential controls only
- **Camera Controls**: Minimalist 2-icon design (üëÅÔ∏è preview toggle, üì∑ camera on/off) - no permission banners (browser handles natively)
- **RAG Toggle**: Compact brain emoji (üß†) design with memory count badge, clean top-left positioning
- **Glass-morphism**: Consistent design across panels (notes, tasks, memory, financial, calendar, object detection)
- **Intuitive settings**: AI providers and PersonI capabilities configuration
- **Visual indicators**: Provider status, PersonI selection, detection stats, FPS counters
- **Unique AI-generated avatars**: Liquid-themed avatars for each PersonI
- **Comprehensive panels**: Notes, Tasks, Memory Management with semantic search, filtering, visual cues
- **User profile panel**: Personal data management
- **Object Detection Overlay**: Green bounding boxes with class labels and confidence percentages
- **Calendar Views**: Month grid, week, day, and agenda views with natural language quick-add
