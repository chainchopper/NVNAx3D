# Nirvana - PersonI AI System

## Overview
Nirvana is an advanced AI companion system designed to provide highly customizable and engaging AI experiences through multiple AI personas (PersonI). It integrates Google's Gemini AI for real-time audio interaction and immersive 3D visualizations. The project aims to be a local-first, multi-provider platform, extensible with various external services, positioning itself as a versatile personal AI ecosystem with significant market potential.

## User Preferences
- **Graphics Preference**: WebGPU over WebGL (better performance)
- **Local-First**: Prefer on-device processing (Whisper for STT)
- **Flexibility**: Manual configuration of all endpoints and services
- **Not locked into Google's ecosystem**: Multi-provider support essential

## System Architecture

### Core Technologies
- **Framework**: Lit (Web Components)
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **AI Provider**: Google Gemini API (@google/genai), with multi-provider support
- **3D Graphics**: Three.js (planned WebGPU migration)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Backend**: Express.js (Node.js) for secure connector API proxy

### UI/UX Decisions
- **Design Philosophy**: Minimalist, glass-morphism, clean, and uncluttered interfaces.
- **Visuals**: AI-generated liquid-themed avatars, dynamic 3D objects with audio-reactive visuals, object detection overlays.
- **Panels**: Comprehensive Notes, Tasks, Memory Management, User Profile, and Calendar views.
- **Usability**: Intuitive settings for AI providers and PersonI capabilities, visual indicators for system status.

### System Design Choices
- **PersonI System**: Manages AI personas with unique attributes, capabilities (vision, image generation, web search, tools, Multi-modal Conversational Pipeline), and a template system. Supports a financial advisor PersonI, BILLY.
- **Connector Backend Proxy**: Secure Express.js server for external service integrations (e.g., Gmail, Google Calendar, GitHub, financial APIs) with OAuth token handling.
- **Model Provider System**: Configures and integrates multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Google, custom) with flexible model selection for conversation, vision, embedding, function calling, and TTS.
- **Memory & RAG System**: Vector-based memory using ChromaDB (with localStorage fallback) and Gemini embedding model, supporting 17 memory types with semantic search and temporal queries.
- **Local Speech-to-Text (STT)**: Browser-based Whisper models (@xenova/transformers) with IndexedDB caching.
- **Enhanced Audio System**: SharedMicrophoneManager, audio recording, real-time music detection, and full OpenAI TTS integration.
- **Environmental Awareness Suite**: Real-time camera-based contextual observation, including Camera-as-3D-Background, Vision-Enhanced Idle Speech, Environmental Observer Service, and multi-format file upload with RAG.
- **Object Recognition System**: Real-time object detection using TensorFlow.js and COCO-SSD model (80 object classes).
- **Voice Command System**: Hands-free control with natural language commands.
- **Routine Automation System**: IF-THEN-THAT automation supporting time-based, event-driven, state monitoring, user actions, and vision detection triggers.
- **Dual PersonI Manager**: Multi-AI collaboration system with four modes: collaborative, debate, teaching, and single.
- **Calendar System**: Visual component with natural language event creation and Google Calendar integration.
- **Security**: CSP hardening, OAuth Vault V2 Backend with PKCE + CSRF protection.
- **Plugin System**: Dynamic UI plugin architecture with registry, sandbox, and persistence.
